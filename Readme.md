## || Day01 || Difference between let and const ||

- Variables declared with let are mutable, which means their values can be reassigned.
- Variables declared with const are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed once assigned.

(For complex data types like objects and arrays, the properties or elements can still be modified.)

- Both let and const have block scope, which means they are only accessible within the block of code where they are defined.
- Variables declared with let can be reassigned with a new value at any time within their scope.
- Variables declared with const cannot be reassigned after their initial assignment. They are constant and their values remain the same throughout their lifetime.

### Arrow Functions

- an arrow function in JavaScript is a shorter and more concise way to write a function. It is denoted by the => syntax.
